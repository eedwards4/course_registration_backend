/** ***************************************************************************
 * @remark CS 315: Definition of Tokenizer class
 *
 * @author Ali Kooshesh and Suzanne Rivoire
 * @file  Tokenizer.hpp
 * @date  Fall 2023
 *
 * @remark You create a Tokenizer object by passing a filename to the 
 *     constructor. The object's job is then to move through the file,
 *     finding and returning one token at a time.
 * 
 * @remark If you've never had to really think about input streams as...well...
 *     streams, you may want to reinforce those concepts. Here are two
 *     good resources -- they contain more info than you need, so just read
 *     enough to have a good mental picture of how to process input,
 *     piece by piece:
